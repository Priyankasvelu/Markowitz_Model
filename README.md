This Python project is designed to perform sophisticated portfolio analysis and optimization using historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. It incorporates a series of financial computation techniques within Python, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and yfinance. The script begins by downloading historical closing prices for a predefined list of stocks and calculates their daily logarithmic returns, which are more suitable for financial models that assume normal distribution. It then performs statistical analyses to compute mean returns and covariance of the stocks on an annual basis. The core of the project involves generating 10,000 random portfolio combinations to evaluate various weight allocations across the stocks, analyzing their risk-return profiles. Utilizing optimization techniques, the script identifies the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratioâ€”representing the best risk-adjusted return. Additionally, the project visualizes the efficient frontier, which graphically represents the set of portfolios that offers the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk. This visualization helps in pinpointing the optimal portfolio on the frontier, demonstrating the best trade-off between risk and return.
